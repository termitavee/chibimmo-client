
This is a little online multiplayer game (chibi = litthe in japanses and mmo) where the player cand discover a medieval-fantasy world.

I've mixed elements from (at least) The Legend of Zelda: Minish Cap, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Bravely Default, Xenoblade Cronicles and Final Fantasy Cristal Cronicles.
